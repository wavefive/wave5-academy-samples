# Wave5 Academy Samples

This repository contains samples give during the Wave5 Academy.
With these sample we show how we build software solutions a [Wave5](https://wave5.nl).

For building our solutions we use the RCode Framework V3 <. You can download the libraries form Nuget. The [Nuget packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/roelandjimenez) contain the symbols of the code, so you can debug the source.
Soon we will migrate the source to GitHub.
